            <p>This project was the project in which we have been working on up to this point. Throughout every single other unit, we have been working up to completing this project to make it the best we possibly could. It is a final culmination of all of our skills and tools we learnt in SEP10. Over the school year, I had decided upon construction for my freedom project, which is what I based my project on. I made my project simple, and easy to read because I did not spend my time wisely, if I had not procrastinated, it would have been better.</p>
            <p>This project was one of the most diffucult under takings I've ever done in my school career. It was not a simple task to complete an over the year project, but I did my best to do so. Some challenges I had when doing this project was procrastination, and not enough time for me to focus on it. This project very well could have been better if I had spent my timer wiser. Some key takeaways is there I should focus on school work more, try not to procrastinate, and that if something is diffucult I should just, do it. After this project, I feel like it is fitting for me to commit to a class where I feel like I can put my skillset to use better, and that is what I will do, by leaving the SEP.</p>
